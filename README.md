### Reflection Questions
# Answer the following questions based on the code you’ve written and tested:

- F: When you create a Pokémon and try to access its fields directly – does it work? Why or why not?
- F: If you later want to add a new property that applies to all Electric-type Pokémon, where should you place it to avoid repetition?
- F: If instead the new property should apply to all Pokémon, where would be the correct place to define it?
- F: What happens if you try to add a Charmander to a list that only allows WaterPokemon?
- F: You want to store different types of Pokémon – Charmander, Squirtle, and Pikachu – in the same list. What type should the list have for that to work?
- F: When you loop through the list and call Attack(), what ensures that the correct attack behavior is executed for each Pokémon?
- F: If you create a method that only exists on Pikachu, why can’t you call it directly when it’s stored in a List<Pokemon>? How could you still access it?
